# Calculate average tsl2 thresholds, number of PHS per participant and define PHS responders
The experimental design includes two experimental factors:
(1) Instruction (2 levels: detect or pain). Participants were instructed to press a button as soon as they perceived a new thermal sensation or a new painful sensation following an auditory cue.
(2) Baseline (3 levels: 32, 38 and 44). Cooling of the skin started at 32, 38 or 44 Celsius degrees. The auditory cue was always presented at 32 Celsius degrees. 

The order of the conditions was fixed across participant and was the following
(1) task = tsl2, instruction = detect, baseline = 32 
(2) task = tsl2, instruction = detect, baseline = 38 
(3) task = tsl2, instruction = detect, baseline = 44 
(4) task = tsl2, instruction = pain, baseline = 32 
(5) task = tsl2, instruction = pain, baseline = 38 
(6) task = tsl2, instruction = pain, baseline = 44 

For each condition, participants completed 6 trials. The first 3 trials were meant to demonstrate the task. The analyses only include the last 3 trials of each condition.
